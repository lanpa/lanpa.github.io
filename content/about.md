I earned BS and MD degrees from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) and worked for a short time in Japan. Later, while pursuing my Ph.D., I also worked as a lecturer. My research interests focus on computer vision and machine learning. I left my Ph.D. program to work as a founding engineer at Berry-AI, a startup focusing on QSR technologies. As the company is now on track and generating steady revenue, I left with my stock options, waiting for a miracle :)

I enjoy cycling and cooking. Recently, I've been exploring video editing. You can check out my YouTube channel, which contains my lecture videos and cycling adventures.
